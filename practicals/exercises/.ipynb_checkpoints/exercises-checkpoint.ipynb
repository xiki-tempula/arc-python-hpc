    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "Go into the directory `darts/` and follow the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the files `darts.py`,`run_darts.py` and `plot_results.py` and understand their structure and functionality.  Run the test file `run_darts.py` and observe the output.  Notice how the number of tries needed for the function `numQuadrantHitsPython` are generated using the `NumPy` function `logspace`.  Verify the code computes $\\pi$ with increasing accuracy as the number of tries (controlled by `numPoints`) increases.\n",

    "   * opens a pool of processes\n",
    "   * use `map_async` to call the function `numQuadrantHitsNumpy` independently from each process\n",

    "\n",
    "   `map_async` is mapped to a Python iterable (array or list) that contains the partial number of tries per process repeated a number of times; this partial number is `numPoints / numProcs`.  While each process carries out only a part of the calculation, together, the processes carry out all the calculations cooncurrently.  The raw results from `map_async` is a Python object; use the `get()` method to retrieve the partial hit counts into a list and the function `sum()` to sum up all the partial hit counts into the total.\n",

    "   After retrieving the partial hit counts using `get()`, print the values.  What do you notice?  What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Modify the function `numQuadrantHitsNumpy` (preferably creating a new one) by adding a random number generator seed using the function `numpy.random.seed()` and the process rank.  In order to map the new function to data using `map_async`, you will need to\n",
    "   * allow `numQuadrantHitsNumpy` to take a tuple as argument, to contain the original `numPoints` as well as the value `seed`;\n",

    "\n",
    "### Integration by the trapezium rule\n",
    "You are asked to evaluate a definite integral using the trapezium rule.  \n",

Run the test file `run_integral.py` followed by `plot_results.py` and observe the output.  Notice how the number of integration intervals `N` needed for the function `trapintPython` are generated using the `NumPy` function `logspace`.  Verify the code computes the value of $\\pi$ with increasing accuracy as the number of intervals (controlled by `N`) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function `trapintPython` computes the integral of a mathematical function defined by `funcPython`, which, in turn, uses the sqrt function from `math`.  Add a new function `trapintNumPy` to `integral.py` that performs the same operations as `trapintPython` but using `NumPy` vectorised operations.  For this purpose, create a `NumPy` version of `funcPython` called `funcNumpy` that uses the sqrt function from `numpy` to operate on an entire array rather than a single scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Modify the file `run_integral.py` to time the execution of the function `trapintNumPy` and verify the accuracy of its result.  Satisfy yourself the execution of the `NumPy` solution is faster than the pure Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Similarly, add a function `trapintNumba` to `integral.py` that performs the same operations as `trapintPython` using the `Numba` JIT compiler:\n",

    "  Again, modify the file `run_integral.py` to time the execution of the function `trapintNumba` and verify the accuracy of its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, copy the source of the `trapintNumpy` function into a file `integral.pyx` and modify this source to create a `Cython` function `trapint` that performs the optimised function of the original `trapintNumpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Start by generating a `Cython` implementation from the original pure Python source:\n",
    "   * create a `distutil` setup file and install the Cython module with `python setup build_ext --inplace`;\n",
    "   * modify the file `run_integral.py` to time the execution of the `Cython` function `trapint` and verify the accuracy of its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Next, work on improving the performance of the `Cython` function `trapint`.  In particular\n",
    "   * type all variables as well as the function itself;\n",
    "   * replace the use of the Python `math` sqrt function with the C equivalent (see hint below);\n",

    "   >\n",
    "   > `from libc.math cimport sqrt`\n",

    "   Further, improve the performance of of the Cython solution via multithreading.  This involves two important aspects:\n",
    "   * releasing the GIL for the main loop in `trapint` and\n",
    "   * using the parallel variant `prange` of the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pass the number of threads to use as an argument to the function `trapint` and use `openmp.omp_set_num_threads()` to set the number of OpenMP threads.  Using different number of threads\n",
    "   * test that the Cython function produces accurate results and\n",
    "   * ensure the performance of the threaded function scales with the number of threads (*i.e.* execution time is nearly halved by doubling the number of threads).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a file `integral_mpi.py` to implement a `mpi4py` version of the test in `run_integral.py`.  Just as the original, the `mpi4py` implementation loops over a range of values for `N` and computes an approximation for the definite integral using the trapezium rule.  Unlike `run_integral.py`, the `mpi4py` version computes the intergal value in a distributed fashion, with each process resposible for calculating the integral for only a part of the original interval of integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here are the steps to follow in writing `integral_mpi.py`:\n",
    "  * Loop over the same range of values for `N` as in `integral_test.py`.  For each value of `N`, each process computes the integral of the function for a part of the interval from `a` to `b`.  Namely, the integration for process `rank` of `size` number of processes is between `aProc` and `bProc`, where\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "        N1 = (float(N)* rank)   / size\n",

    "        aProc = a + N1 * h\n",
    "        bProc = a + N2 * h\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Each process uses the `NumPy` function `trapintNumPy` for the calculation of a partial integral value `valProc`, computed between the limits `aProc` and `bProc` and using a number of intervals equal to `N2-N1`.\n",
    "  * The total value of the integral (between `a` and `b`) is obtained from sum-reducing all the partial results `valProc`.  This is achieved by placing the partial result on each process in a vector of size 1 and by reducing all these partial vectors across all processes to a final result vector on a single process, typically the rank 0.\n",
    "  * Use the function `MPI.Wtime()` to measure execution time for each value of `N`.\n",
    "  * The approximated value for the integral (or the absolute error) is printed by the process of rank 0 only, along with the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Demonstrate to yourself that the performance of `integrate_mpi.py` scales with the number of processes used (*i.e.* execution time is nearly halved by doubling the number of processes).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, run both `run_integral.py` and `integral_mpi.py` and use `plot_results.py` in order to cross-compare all the 4 solutions.  Thus, for the same number `N` of intervals, make sure that\n",
    "  * the same level of accuracy in estimating the integral is achieved with all solution;\n",
    "  * execution time for the `Cython` implementation (with 1 thread) and the `Numba` one should be comparable;\n",
    "  * execution time for the `Cython` implementation (with 2 and 4 threads) and the `mi4py` one (with 2 and 4 processes, respectively) should also be comparable."
